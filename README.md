# Tic Tac Toe

Time to put your knowledge of Javascript and jQuery to the test!

Enclosed you'll find an already made tic-tac-toe board. Your job is to make the game actually work using Javascript and jQuery.

- You can add as many `class` and `id` attributes as you need to the HTML
- jQuery has already been added
- Don't worry about CSS, just make the game work!

Here are the user stories:

Gameplay:
- When the page loads, Player 1 (X) is the first player to go
- When Player 1 clicks an *empty* cell, it should be marked with an "X", and `Current Player` should switch to two
- When Player 2 clicks an *empty* cell, it should be marked with an "O", and `Current Player` should switch back to one
- If a player clicks a cell that has already been marked, they should see an alert letting them know that the cell in question has already been taken

Winning:
- When a player gets three in a row in any direction, the board should should be wiped clean, and that player's score should be incremented
- The game should then start over with the losing player getting to go first

## Bonus

No game is complete without some kind of easter egg. Add a cheat code, or something along those lines to make the game more interesting!
